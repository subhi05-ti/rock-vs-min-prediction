# rock-vs-mine-prediction
## overview

This project is a Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a Rock (underwater rock) or a Mine (explosive).
It uses the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset consists of 60 features, each representing energy levels of sonar signals bounced off different surfaces, and one target column:
R → Rock
M → Mine

## Objective

To build a classification model that can correctly identify whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine using supervised learning techniques.
